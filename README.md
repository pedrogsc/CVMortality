# Artificial intelligence for risk prediction using office and ambulatory blood pressure

## Introduction

In here you may find the models described in the manusctipt. 

Hypertension continues to be the leading risk factor for premature death worldwide and typically clusters with other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, hence quantification of total CV risk is essential for individualizing treatment.

We developed and validated a novel, deep learning-derived model to predict CV mortality using 10 clinical variables based on a large cohort of patients.
With this web tool we want to provide wide access to this software. It allows you to upload the values  yourself, and provides an indicative risk score [0-1]. All fields are mandatory for calculation.

## Data availability

An example csv file is given to show how the models can be used. 

## Prerequisites

* Python (3.8)
* numpy (1.23.5)
* tensorflow (2.11.0)
* pandas (1.5.2)

## Reference

The manuscript supporting these models is currently under submission.
This section will be updated to have the full details for referencing purposes.
